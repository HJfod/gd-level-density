# GD Level Density Checker

### How to install:

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Download the project as a ZIP file.

3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to an empty folder.

4. Type `cmd` in your Windows start menu to open the command line.

5. Type `cd "C:\path\to\your\folder"` to navigate to the folder.

6. Type `npm install` and wait for it to finish installing. (If it looks like it's frozen, it's most likely not.)

7. Type `npm start` to run the program.

### How to use:

1. Install [GDShare](https://github.com/HJfod/gd-backup/releases/latest). (This lets you export levels from your GD save file).

    - [Instructions for installation](https://github.com/HJfod/gd-backup#how-to-download)

2. Export a level with GDShare and save the .gmd file somewhere.

3. Click `Select level` to open the .gmd file.

4. Wait for it to create a chart of the level's density. If it takes an absurdly long time, press Ctrl + Shift + I and see if there are any errors in the console.
